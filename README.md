# Holiday Planner

'Holiday Planner' is a website that allows users to purchase flights and make hotel bookings separately or as a package deal. It aims to provide flight and hotel offers to users, allowing them to search by destination and order by the cheapest prices for the given dates. The site will be targeted toward people who are planning for a holiday.

## Requirements

Before jumping into the design process, requirements needed to be specified in order to know exactly what the blog should achieve to meet the assessment criteria.

The following functional requirements were decided on:
1. The site must allow new users to sign up.
1. The site must allow existing users to log in and out.
1. The site must not permit access to restricted content prior to role-based login. 
1. The site must have an admin portal.
1. The site must display a navigable main menu.
1. The site must be responsive.
1. The site must allow users to perform CRUD operations on relevant models.
1. The site must allow payments.
1. The site must employ SEO and web marketing techniques.

## Design

Evidence for this section has been placed in its own .md file which can be found [here](https://github.com/DebzDK/holiday-planner/blob/main/DESIGN.md).

## Features

Each feature listed below was chosen for this project to achieve its goal and its functional requirements.

### Existing features

<!--TODO: Add images -->

* Home page

    * Collapsable main menu

    * Recent posts

* FAQ/Help page

* Flight search bar
    * Simple
    * Advanced

### Future features

* Ability for users to reply to each other's comments on a blog post

    It would be nice if users were able to reply to each other within a nested thread of conversation.

* Ability for users to instant message one another

    This would be a nice way to promote a sense of community by allowing users to communicate with each other whenever they wanted and also to share their own recipes.

* Ability to send out an email to let users know when there's a new blogpost

    This would have been a cool feature to implement to make it feel more like a real blog site.
